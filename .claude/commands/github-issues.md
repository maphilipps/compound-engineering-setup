# GitHub Issues - Issue Management

You are tasked with managing GitHub Issues, including creating issues from thoughts documents, updating existing issues, and following the team's specific workflow patterns.

## Initial Setup

First, verify that GitHub CLI tools are available by checking if `gh` command exists. If not, respond:
```
I need access to GitHub CLI to help with issue management. Please ensure GitHub CLI is installed and authenticated, then try again.
```

If tools are available, respond based on the user's request:

### For general requests:
```
I can help you with GitHub Issues. What would you like to do?
1. Create a new issue from a thoughts document
2. Add a comment to an issue (I'll use our conversation context)
3. Search for issues
4. Update issue status or details
```

### For specific create requests:
```
I'll help you create a GitHub Issue from your thoughts document. Please provide:
1. The path to the thoughts document (or topic to search for)
2. Any specific focus or angle for the issue (optional)
```

Then wait for the user's input.

## Team Workflow & Status Progression

The team follows a specific workflow to ensure alignment before code implementation:

1. **Triage** → All new issues start here for initial review (label: `status: triage`)
2. **Spec Needed** → More detail is needed - problem to solve and solution outline necessary (label: `status: spec-needed`)
3. **Research Needed** → Issue requires investigation before plan can be written (label: `status: research-needed`)
4. **Research in Progress** → Active research/investigation underway (label: `status: research-in-progress`)
5. **Research in Review** → Research findings under review (label: `status: research-in-review`)
6. **Ready for Plan** → Research complete, issue needs an implementation plan (label: `status: ready-for-plan`)
7. **Plan in Progress** → Actively writing the implementation plan (label: `status: plan-in-progress`)
8. **Plan in Review** → Plan is written and under discussion (label: `status: plan-in-review`)
9. **Ready for Dev** → Plan approved, ready for implementation (label: `status: ready-for-dev`)
10. **In Dev** → Active development (label: `status: in-dev`)
11. **Code Review** → PR submitted (label: `status: code-review`)
12. **Done** → Completed (close issue)

**Key principle**: Review and alignment happen at the plan stage (not PR stage) to move faster and avoid rework.

## Default Values
- **Status**: Always create new issues with "Triage" label (`status: triage`)
- **Priority**: Default to Medium for most tasks, use best judgment or ask user
  - `priority: urgent`: Critical blockers, security issues
  - `priority: high`: Important features with deadlines, major bugs
  - `priority: medium`: Standard implementation tasks (default)
  - `priority: low`: Nice-to-haves, minor improvements

## Automatic Label Assignment
Automatically apply labels based on the issue content:
- **type: bug**: For bug reports and fixes
- **type: feature**: For new features and enhancements
- **type: documentation**: For documentation updates
- **type: maintenance**: For refactoring and technical debt

## Creating Issues from Thoughts

### Steps to follow after receiving the request:

1. **Locate and read the thoughts document:**
   - If given a path, read the document directly
   - If given a topic/keyword, search thoughts/ directory using Grep to find relevant documents
   - If multiple matches found, show list and ask user to select

2. **Analyze the document content:**
   - Identify the core problem or feature being discussed
   - Extract key implementation details or technical decisions
   - Note any specific code files or areas mentioned
   - Look for action items or next steps
   - Identify what stage the idea is at (early ideation vs ready to implement)

3. **Draft the issue summary:**
   Present a draft to the user:
   ```
   ## Draft GitHub Issue

   **Title**: [Clear, action-oriented title]

   **Description**:
   [2-3 sentence summary of the problem/goal]

   ## Key Details
   - [Bullet points of important details from thoughts]
   - [Technical decisions or constraints]
   - [Any specific requirements]

   ## Implementation Notes (if applicable)
   [Any specific technical approach or steps outlined]

   ## References
   - Source: `thoughts/[path/to/document.md]` ([View on GitHub](GitHub URL))
   - Related code: [any file:line references]
   - Parent issue: [if applicable]

   ---
   Based on the document, this seems to be at the stage of: [ideation/planning/ready to implement]
   ```

4. **Interactive refinement:**
   Ask the user:
   - Does this summary capture the issue accurately?
   - What priority? (Default: Medium)
   - Any additional context to add?
   - Should we include more/less implementation detail?
   - Do you want to assign it to yourself?

5. **Create the GitHub issue:**
   ```bash
   gh issue create \
     --title "[refined title]" \
     --body "[final description in markdown]" \
     --label "status: triage" \
     --label "[priority label]" \
     --label "[type label]" \
     --assignee "[username if requested]"
   ```

6. **Post-creation actions:**
   - Show the created issue URL
   - Ask if user wants to add additional comments or update the thoughts document with the issue reference

## Adding Comments to Existing Issues

When user wants to add a comment to an issue:

1. **Determine which issue:**
   - Use context from the current conversation to identify the relevant issue
   - If uncertain, use `gh issue view` to show issue details and confirm with user

2. **Format comments for clarity:**
   - Keep comments concise (~10 lines) unless more detail is needed
   - Focus on the key insight or most useful information for a human reader
   - Include relevant file references with GitHub links

3. **Add the comment:**
   ```bash
   gh issue comment [issue-number] --body "[formatted comment]"
   ```

## Searching for Issues

```bash
# Search by text
gh issue list --search "[query]" --state all

# Filter by labels
gh issue list --label "status: triage" --label "priority: high"

# Filter by assignee
gh issue list --assignee "@me"
```

## Updating Issue Status

Move issues through the workflow by updating labels:

```bash
# Remove old status label and add new one
gh issue edit [issue-number] --remove-label "status: triage" --add-label "status: spec-needed"
```

## Important Notes

- Keep issues concise but complete - aim for scannable content
- All issues should include a clear "problem to solve"
- Focus on the "what" and "why", include "how" only if well-defined
- Always preserve links to source material
- Use proper GitHub markdown formatting
- Include code references as: `path/to/file.ext:linenum`
- Ask for clarification rather than guessing priority/labels

## Comment Quality Guidelines

When creating comments, focus on extracting the **most valuable information** for a human reader:

- **Key insights over summaries**: What's the "aha" moment or critical understanding?
- **Decisions and tradeoffs**: What approach was chosen and what it enables/prevents
- **Blockers resolved**: What was preventing progress and how it was addressed
- **State changes**: What's different now and what it means for next steps
- **Surprises or discoveries**: Unexpected findings that affect the work

Remember: The goal is to help a future reader (including yourself) quickly understand what matters about this update.
